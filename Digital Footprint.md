MY RESEARCH:
A digital footprint is the trail of data we leave behind whenever we use the internet. This includes everything from the websites we visit, the searches we perform, the ads we click on, to the posts we like or share on social media.

I believe I left digital footprints while commenting on a reel today. Also, I did research on all these topics related to coding so I will probably get a few advertisements catering to these services. Then, I also registered likes on many-many reels. Others can see my likes and that is another example. Other than these, I can't think of anything else.

When you search for a product on Amazon, a small file called a cookie or a tracking pixel records your activity. This data is then shared with third-party ad networks like Google Ads or Facebook Pixel, which Amazon partners with. These networks track your online behavior across multiple websites and apps by linking your device or browser through a unique advertising ID. So when you later open Instagram or YouTube, which are also connected to these ad networks, they detect your interest in that product and automatically serve you a targeted ad based on your recent activity. This seamless ad targeting is part of whatâ€™s called cross-site behavioral tracking, and it's how your online searches quickly follow you across the internet.
