## Uniquely Decodable Code and Huffman Coding"

### Difficulty Level: Hard

### Instructions
You have been give the sentence: 
`Hi, by doing this activity, you just learned what uniquely decodable code is. Good job!`

1. Make a frequency table: count how many times each character appears (including space, punctuations, and uppercase and lowercase letters separately).
2. Construct a Huffman Tree: use bottom-up approach and combine the two least frequency characters at each step; show the final tree with characters as leaf nodes.
3. Assign code: for each character, write down the binary code, tracing from the root to each leaf. 
```
Left edge: 0
Right edge: 1
```
4. Encode: encode the full sentence into a binary string using the Huffman code you wrote.
5. Decode: given the binary string, decode it back to the original sentence.

SHREEVAR'S PART:

## ANSWER 1:
I constructed a frequency table by hand. Please let me know if you would like a photo of that.

## ANSWER 2:
I used software to construct the Huffman tree and have attached the tree in the mail I sent you.

## ANSWER 3:
The codes have been attached and are visible in the same picture.

## ANSWER 4:
This is the sentence as a binary string using the Huffman code I wrote: 001001111010100111010001010011001111111111010000000101110011001010111010111110000010110011011101010001110011001001010011100100111100111100001100111011101101101010110010000000100100001001011111000101101010000001101100011100001110001010001110011010101001100111100110110111101110000100011010110011101011011110111100111011101011100100011001011111111111011111000011111110001010110

## ANSWER 5:
After translating the binary string using the table of binary codes we had created for each character, we get the original sentence which is: 
Hi, by doing this activity, you just learned what uniquely decodable code is. Good job!

THOUGHTS:
This was a unique experience for me, another day, another topic. Every day of this MakerSpace, I have learned something new, something in the world of Computer Science and it has been a lovely journey. Grateful to the whole team!!
