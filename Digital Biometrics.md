### QUESTIONS & ANSWERS

What is biometric data? What forms of it do you use every day without realizing?
#Answer - Biometrics is the measurement of physiological characteristics like – but not limited to – fingerprint, iris patterns, or facial features that can be used to identify an individual. NIST has been conducting research in the area of biometrics for over 60 years, with work on fingerprint technologies for the FBI to support law enforcement and forensics dating back to the 1960s.
We might use biometric data daily when unlocking our phone with Face ID or a fingerprint, logging into apps with facial recognition, or using voice assistants like Siri or Alexa that recognize our voice.

Where is your data going — stored locally on device, or uploaded to a server?
#Answer - It depends on the system. For example, Apple stores Face ID and Touch ID data locally on your device in a secure enclave. However, some apps and services like certain facial recognition platforms or security systems may upload and store biometric data on remote servers, potentially increasing privacy risks.

What’s the biggest risk if biometric data is leaked? (Hint: you can change your password, but not your face.)
#Answer - If biometric data is compromised, it cannot be changed like a password. A leaked fingerprint, face, or iris scan could permanently affect our ability to securely verify our identity, opening the door to identity theft, surveillance, or impersonation.

Look into one real-world incident (e.g., Aadhaar biometric leak, Clearview AI, etc.) and write a 2–3 line summary of what happened.
#Answer - In 2018, India’s Aadhaar system, which stores biometric and demographic data of over a billion people, suffered a major breach. Unauthorized access was reportedly being sold online, allowing buyers to obtain names, addresses, and biometric details, raising serious concerns about privacy, surveillance, and identity theft.
