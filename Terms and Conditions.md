SHREEVAR'S PART:

Instagram collects a lot of data about me, like my personal info - name, email, phone number, birthday and everything I share, such as photos, videos, messages etc. They also track how I interact on the app, like what I like you know, comment on, share, and who I connect with, plus details about my device, IP address, and my location if I allow it.

The main reason they collect all this is to probably show personalized ads, which is how they make money. They also use my data to keep me hooked by improving the app experience and like add new features.

It’s definitely something to think about. I’m okay with targeted ads in exchange for free use and a more personalized experience, so I’m willing to accept the trade-off. I can also adjust my settings to limit what’s collected or look into other ways to protect my privacy if I want.
